I"Š<p><em>Convergence</em> has received a lot of questions regarding the schoolâ€™s newly announced plan for schooling next year. We compiled these questions into an in-depth interview with Mr. Bardai. This interview contains detailed answers to all these great questions, including why the school is being divided into two groups by house, how the extra-curricular and athletics programs will resume, how assessments and exams will proceed, how attendance will be taken, and much more. Also, in this issue, we present a way for everyone to document your experiences, actions, and opinions during this pandemic into the schoolâ€™s archived history.</p>
