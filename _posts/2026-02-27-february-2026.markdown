Uncertainty fills the air, and yet, beyond the haze, opportunity is on the horizon. This February issue of Convergence unpacks the state of shifting realities. Catch an exclusive interview with Mr. Walker on overcrowding, an overview of the Systems Transformation Pathway, and opposing perspectives from Ms. Ferguson and a student on AI. Additionally, on the Blue Page, our opinion publication, you will find critical commentaries on the school hymn and the speech skills of the common UCC student. Moving Towards The Future is a difficult task, but one this issue will broaden your perspective on.
