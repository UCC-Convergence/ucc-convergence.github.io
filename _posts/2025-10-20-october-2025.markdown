A new school year brings new perspectives. New leadership. New momentum. This October issue of *Convergence* celebrates a year of extraordinary achievements, including Founders Cup, Bags to Beds, TEDx, and more. It also features bold new perspectives from the Board of Stewards and an exclusive interview with Mr. DeGiorgio.<br><br>
*"The De Giorgio Interview" by Dean Trojniak and Jack Zambonini, published in Convergence, Volume XXVI, Issue I (October 2025), misidentified Ms. Xu and Ms. White as secretaries. Their correct titles are Administrative Assistant, Attendance/Operations and Administrative Assistant, Receptionist, respectively.*
