The past months at the college have been marked by insightful, engaging student-led events like the World Affairs Conference and the World Languages Week. This March issue of *Convergence* features an article and exclusive interview with Mr. Martin Luther King III, the keynote speaker of WAC, as well as coverage of the organization behind the various activities at the WLW. Mr. King's message about societal progress and the festivities' exploration of different cultures implore us to work toward a future of sharing our ideas, beliefs and humanity. Fortunately, at UCC, we have just the opportunities to do so.
