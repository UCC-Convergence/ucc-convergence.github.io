Convergence is proud to release its March, “Around the World” Edition, especially relevant as it prefaces the many travels people will take during the March Break. We feature an interesting second part to staff reporter Ferrari Zhang’s experience as an exchange student in France, a political editorial on Bonnie Crombie’s position in the Liberal Party, a talent show report remembering one of UCC’s most lively assemblies and a compelling political report on the Dutch Election.
