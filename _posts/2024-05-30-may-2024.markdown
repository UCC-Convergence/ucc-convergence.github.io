*Convergence* is excited to release its May Special Edition, "Did Justin Trudeau's Government Fail? We Decide." With our MP Carolyn Bennett's resignation, there will be a by-election in our riding, Toronto St. Paul's, on June 24th. We, the UCC community, are an important constituency in this riding and can potentially determine whether Trudeau keeps his job (hint: if the Liberals are defeated here, it's kind of over for them) or not. My goal is to tell you about all the candidates, and we start with the Liberal candidate, Leslie Church, along with (many) satirical entries and a basic overview. Enjoy!
