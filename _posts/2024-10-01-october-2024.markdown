Our recent American election survey has produced valuable insights regarding UCC community members' views on the upcoming presidential election. More importantly, over 80 students and faculty members have left us thoughtful and fascinating comments on this issue.

In this election special, *Convergence* publishes the results of the survey and many student comments. We hope they will depict a comprehensive picture of the diverse opinions regarding this critical election during this uncertain time. Ahead of tonight's Vice Presidential Debate, we hope you will learn something!

We must underscore that these opinions do not represent *Convergence*'s political views. We solely seek to illuminate the student body's vast perspectives on the issue.
